        <p>About</p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love to code and study about physics and chemistry also about maths because they all are just amazing! Also because they solve the real-world problems. For example: Good software also made our lives a million easier and it is not exaggeration, can you imagine your day without touching your phone or laptop even once? Obviously not. And it will basiclally be useless if it dosen't have an OS like ios, android, macOS, Windows etc. And science to satisfy our Curiosity about the unknown and answer burning question. From small ones like why does Ice float on water? to big ones like How did the universe came to be?</p>

        <p>I really like this book about matter, energy, forces and earth science. I is very good for anyone who wants to know more about physics, earth science etc. Right now I am  at Chapter-2 and it has already become very intersting for me. I highly reccomned it for a beginner in physics and earth science.</p>

       <p>My insperation has always been NASA because NASA dicsoves a lot of data about universe and our planet. Not only that it also discoves so many helpful technolgies that better improve life on earth. It's impact is undenable.They have the abilty to burn the importance and results of pure physics, math, enginering, couputer science and science in genral into the minds of everyone they reach.</p>
